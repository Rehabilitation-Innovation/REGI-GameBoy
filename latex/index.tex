Introducing \doxylink{class_tiny_engine}{Tiny\+Engine}, this is a basic and small game engine for rendering 2D graphics to a framebuffer. The main use of this engine is currently on the Rehab\+Tendo at the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital. I created this as part of my Coop work term project, it uses a custom PCB fabricated to integrate different control methods for rehabilitation excersises.

Here is a prototype PCB and the first revision of the case design.

The repository is structured to represent a conventional C++ program. src and inc folders have segragated headers and sources. Lib has all of the external libraries used.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{How to build\+:}{How to build\+:}}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
This source is a static library and requires a sub project dependency to be ran. For Further guidence please view Confluence guides on compilation and flashing.
